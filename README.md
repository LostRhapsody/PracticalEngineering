# Practical Engineering

A technology mod for Hytale focused on adding "practical" implementations of generating electricity and using it to power various machines.

## Status

Practically not started. I haven't written Java in a few years, haven't made a mod in a decade. This will be a slow start.

## Goals

- Simple, extensible API for electricity management
- Blocks for generating, storing, and transporting electricity
- Blocks that consume electricity for manufacturing, transport, etc
