# Practical Engineering

A technology mod for Hytale focused on adding "practical" implementations of generating electricity and using it to power various machines.

## Status

Practically not started. I haven't written Java in a few years, haven't made a mod in a decade. This will be a slow start.

## Goals

- Simple, extensible API for electricity management
- Blocks for generating, storing, and transporting electricity
- Blocks that consume electricity for manufacturing, transport, etc

## Tech Stack/Tooling

This is here because I'm new to Java's ecosystem, and I'll forget what to do everytime I set up a project.

- Kotlin DSL (build.gradle.kts)
- JUnit 5 for testing
- Spotless with google-java-format
- IntelliJ's built-in linting and static analysis

If Hytale releases a modding SDK with differing opinions, we'll ditch these in favor of that. I have no strong opinions about Java.
